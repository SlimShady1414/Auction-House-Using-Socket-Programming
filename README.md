# Auction-House-Using-Socket-Programming
This is a python based client-server program which implements auction system.

Description of the server code:-
The program uses Python's socket module to create a server and establish connections with clients. It also uses threading to handle multiple client connections concurrently. The program uses a lock to ensure that only one client can submit a new offer at a time, and it uses global variables to keep track of the highest offer and the winning client.The program allows users to enter the number of products and clients in the auction, the name and price of each product, and the name of each client. Then it creates a server on the localhost and listens for incoming client connections. Once all clients have connected, the auction starts.\For each product, the server sends a message to all clients to inform them that the auction will start in 5 seconds and what the minimum price for the product is. After the 5 seconds, the server asks all clients to submit their first offer for the product. The server then finds the highest offer and sends a message to all clients informing them of the current highest offer and asking for a new offer. When a new offer is submitted, the server finds the new highest offer and repeats the process until no one makes a higher offer for two consecutive turns.

Description of the client code:-
This client code creates a socket object and connects to a server at localhost on port 9999. It then enters a loop where it receives messages from the server, splits the message into words, and determines the appropriate action based on the last word of the message. If the message requests the client's name, it prompts the user for input and sends the name back to the server. If the message requests the client's first price offer, it prompts the user for input and sends the offer back to the server. If the last word of the message is "offered", it prompts the user for their counter-offer and sends it back to the server. Otherwise, it simply prints the message received from the server.
